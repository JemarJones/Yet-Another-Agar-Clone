	 There are many facets to the implementation of Agar.io. For the proof of concept demonstration, we plan to complete, at the very least, a game board on which multiple players can exist and move. We believe that the game mechanics will not be a huge challenge, but that the difficult part of the project that is a significant risk is the multiplayer server.


	For the implementation of our server we will be using the Node.js javascript runtime enviroment. Setting up Node.js on a local computer is fairly trivial. We also intend to host an instance of our server publicly. We will also be installing a testing framework, Mocha.js. Though we do not foresee any difficulty in using Mocha for unit testing, the more graphical components of our Agar.io implementation may be more challenging to test explicitly.
