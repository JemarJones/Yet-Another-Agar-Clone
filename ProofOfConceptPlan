\section*{
	There are many facets to the implementation of Agar.io. For the proof of concept demonstration, we plan to complete, at the very least, a game board on which multiple players can exist and move. We believe that the game mechanics will not be a huge challenge, but that the difficult part of the project that is a significant risk is the multiplayer server.
}
\section*{
	For the implementation of our server we will be using Node.js. Node.js is very easy to install. We will also be installing a testing framework, Mocha.js.
