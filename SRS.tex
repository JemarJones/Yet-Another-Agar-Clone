\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{Purpose of the Project}
\textbf{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
The purpose of Agar.io is to reinvent the way simple multiplayer games work and provide inspiration to the open source game development community. Most multiplayer games nowadays whether they are web-based, desktop, console or mobile, require signups. This is meant to be extremely easy to jump into while still providing a competitive and challenging environment to keep the user engaged and addicted.

The game itself revolves around players starting off as small blobs who can then move around and consume other player blobs to keep increasing in size. Your goal is to be the biggest fish in the pond. However, there’s a catch. The bigger you are, the slower you get and there are plenty of other players on the playing field. The player has to be smart and quick witted to climb the score board.

\subsection{Users of the Product}
\textbf{Hands-On Users}

The initial users of the product will be limited to our team and the students enrolled in the 3XA3 course.

Once the project goes live on a public domain, the users will be anyone with access to the website from a Windows, Mac OSX or mobile OS platform like iOS or Android.

All users are assumed to have some experience with games and how they work.\\
\textbf{Priorities Assigned to Users}\\

\textbf{Key Users:} General Public (Windows, Mac OSX, iOS & Android)

\textbf{Secondary Users:} Professor, Developers and Testers\\\\
\textbf{User Participation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Users playing the game are prompted to use an anonymous name that they can create. No credentials are needed or stored.
\item No user data is stored. Every session requires a new name to be created by the user.
\end{enumerate}
Maintenance Users and Service Technicians

These are the developers. (Our team)
\section{Project Constraints}
\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\textbf{Solution Constraints}

The most important mandated constraint is the server. We will be hosting the game on our own server which means the game can only support a certain number of concurrent players before reaching a performance threshold. This also means latency will differ greatly based on where the game is accessed from.\\
\textbf{Implementation Environment}

The coding languages used will be web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
Frameworks such as Socket.io, jQuery, Fabric.js, Paper.js, Create.js and Bootstrap will also be utilized.
Node.js is a javascript runtime environment that will be used along with Socket.io to create the server and host the game.
The development will utilize code editors such as Brackets or Sublime Text. We will also be using Bash or Windows PowerShell to commit & push and run appropriate documentation tools.\\
\textbf{Partner or Collaborative Applications}

not applicable\\
\textbf{Off-the-shelf Software}

not applicable\\
\textbf{Anticipated Workplace Environment}

This game will be mostly used at home and on the move.\\
\textbf{Schedule Constraints}

The deadline for the project is around mid-December, which gives our team around 3 months of development time.

Final Demo: Week of November 30th, 2015 
Final Documentation: December 8th, 2015\\
\textbf{Budget Constraints}

not applicable
\subsection{Naming Conventions & Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Port: The Node.js server will run on a certain network location also known as the port.}
\item{Ping: The latency between the client playing the game and the server.}
\item{Web socket: Allows a persistent connection between the client and the server which means both parties can start sending data at any time without requiring an HTTP connection or long polling.}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Relevant Facts & Assumptions}

Facts

People love games. A simple, fast-paced and challenging game that users can play anywhere, anytime with no time commitment is most likely to be highly successful.

Assumptions

The game will only run well on the future-friendly browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari and Mozilla Firefox. Thus we are assuming the game will mostly be played on these browsers whether on desktop or mobile.

\caption{Case diagram \label{overflow}}
\end{figure}

\textbf{c) Individual Product Use Cases}\newline\\
1. Product Use Case Name: Enter Game\newline
Trigger: Player types name and presses play. \newline
Preconditions: A player is not already in the middle of a game. \newline
Interested Stakeholders: The player, the client, and the developers. \newline
Actors: Player, Game Server, Database \newline
Outcome: If the users name is not already taken, then they are now a player in the currently live game session.\newline\\
2. Product Use Case Name: Change Position\newline
Trigger: Player moves pointer in the direction of the new position.\newline
Preconditions: Player is currently playing the game, is still alive, and there is a position in the direction the player has placed their pointer. \newline
Interested Stakeholders: The player, the client, and the developers. \newline
Actors: Player, Game Server, Database \newline
Outcome: The player is moved to a position an increment of X away in the direction the pointer was placed (relative to their current position).\newline\\
3. Product Use Case Name: Eat\newline
Trigger: A players position completely overlaps the position of a smaller food/other player. \newline
Preconditions: Player is currently playing the game, and is still alive. \newline
Interested Stakeholders: The player, the client, and the developers. \newline
Actors: Player, Game Server, Database \newline
Outcome: The food or other player dissapears and/or dies. The player doing the "eating" has their mass increase by the mass of the food/other player at the time of "eating".\newline\\
4. Product Use Case Name: Eaten\newline
Trigger: A players position is completely overlapped by another larger player.\newline
Preconditions: Player is currently playing the game, and is still alive. \newline
Interested Stakeholders: The player, the client, and the developers. \newline
Actors: Player, Game Server, Database \newline
Outcome: The players screen goes black, they are told theyve died, and there final score/mass is displayed. Afer a brief moment they are allowed to enter the game again if they wish. \newline

\section{Project Issues}
\subsection{Open Issues}
Currently our team has minimal experience with web socketing, servers and Node.js, thus development of the back-end of the game will take the most time and we expect to face many hurdles and roadblocks.
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
not applicable
\subsection{New Problems}
Potential User Problems

We need to take care in setting the colors for the blobs so we can keep the color-blind in mind. We also need to meticulously design any animations so they don’t induce any seizures.

Follow-up Problems

Need to look into how many concurrent players a Node.js and Socket.io server can handle at once. Also need to look into how to handle player disconnections.
\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Work on the proof of concept
\item Get game ready for revision 0 project demonstration
\item Create a user guide for the project
\item Write up a test report
\item Demonstrate Final Project
\item Finalize Documentation
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
not applicable
\subsection{Risks}
There are no risks associated with this game.
\subsection{Costs}
not applicable
\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
User’s will be given a short tutorial if requested before the game begins. The help option for commands will always be present on the game screen. Other than that, no documentation is required since it will be a fairly simple game.
\subsection{Waiting Room}
In the future, this can be ported to be an iOS or android app with more intuitive controls than a keyboard and mouse.
\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
